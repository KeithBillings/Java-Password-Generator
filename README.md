# Java-Password-Generator

## Getting Started

In this assignment I was tasked with writing a section of javascript code that would generate a random password and write it into a text box for the user to copy. I chose to use text boxes to select password parameters instead of prompts to save the user time and effort. The user can input a number to determine the string length of the password. The user can select to add capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
